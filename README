This software computes the quantization determinant involving
the box matrix B and the Ktilde matrix which relates two-particle
interaction energies in finite volume to the scattering matrix.
An overview of this software is given in the paper below:

See comments in the file "box_quant.h" for information on the
important class "BoxQuantization".

See comments in the file "box_matrix.h" for information on the
class "BoxMatrix".

See comments in the file "K_matrix.h" for information on the
classes "KtildeMatrixCalculator" and "KtildeInverseCalculator".

There are two sample driver programs "driver1.cc" and "driver2.cc".
"driver1.cc" creates the needed objects from XML input given in
"input1.xml".  "driver2.cc" creates the objects in the code itself.

Tables of the block diagonal basis states and explicit expressions
for the box matrix elements are given in the file "box_matrix.pdf".
